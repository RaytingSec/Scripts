Bash-Scripts
============

Bash scripts written primarily to automate, streamline, and assist with tasks on my Linux machines

These should be run only if the code has been reviewed and is compatible with your system. A varying degree of manual editing is also needed to get these working, i.e. server URLs.

update:
Simple script that automates the apt-get update and upgrade command. Should be fully working "out of the box".

backup:
Currently broken and will be fixed!
Takes predefined directories and files and compresses into a timestamped tar. It comes preloaded to backup most files for apache2, fail2ban, and openssh. 

firstboot:
Automates setting up a new Linux machine. Check contents and know what you're doing before running this yourself. Not fully tested.

raydartools:
Common commands I use with my server. Not actually very practical, but saves some finger movement and memorization.

wgetter:
A simple script that loops through designated URLs and applies the wget command to simultaneously download a series files in the background. For example, I used it to download a podcast archive. Coding on the user's part is REQURIED and will not work as-is.

More to come!
