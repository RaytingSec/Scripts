# Shell-Scripts

### DESCRIPTION

This repository has scripts for both Windows and Linux systems. They are primarily to automate, streamline, and assist with tasks on my machines.

### DIRECTORIES

**Bash**
Linux Bash scripts with a varying degree of usability. Some work, some don't. Review code before using

**DOS**
Batch scripts that run on the MS-DOS shell. They're simple and ready to use. They probably won't be further developed.
