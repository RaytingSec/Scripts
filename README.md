Bash-Scripts
============

DESCRIPTION

This repository has scripts for both Windows and Linux systems. They are primarily to automate, streamline, and assist with tasks on my machines.

DIRECTORIES

Bash
Linux, Debian to be precise, scripts that should be run only if the code has been reviewed and is compatible with your system. A varying degree of manual editing is also needed to get these working, i.e. server URLs.

Win32
I named this Batch, but it was too similar to Bash. These are Batch scripts that interact with the Windows shell. They're simple and probably won't be further developed.

More to come!
