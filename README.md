Bash-Scripts
============

DESCRIPTION

This repository has scripts for both Windows and Linux systems. They are primarily to automate, streamline, and assist with tasks on my machines.

DIRECTORIES

Bash:  
Linux, Debian to be precise, scripts that should be run only if the code has been reviewed and is compatible with your system. A varying degree of manual editing is also needed to get these working, i.e. server URLs.

Batch:  
These are Batch scripts that interact with the Windows shell. They're simple and ready to use. They probably won't be further developed.
